# Stroop EEG - Stroop task + EEG

## The experiment: 
    
In this task subjects must report the colour of the letters spelling each word, but letters themselves also spell a colour name and this may be the same or different to the colour of the letters. Stroop (1935) reports that reaction times are slower the letters spell a colour that is incongruent with the colour of the letters, indicating a compulsory automated reading of the word.

This experiment has been modified from the original PsychoPy demo script to include calls for EGI EEG amplifiers. The program will connect, record, and send tags for each stimulus as well as each response.
